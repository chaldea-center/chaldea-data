How am I supposed to pester her if she won't seriously fear and be wary of me...?\"\n\n\nTherefore, she made her decision. This is where she'll aim for the home run. Change her name tag from the god of love to the Demon King of corruption and display her presence for everyone to see.\n\nAnd then came the summer, her perfect chance.\n\n\n\"I'll take this nice opportunity and do my best to corrupt Master. I mean, just look at me. Who wouldn't be corrupted if I acted all lovey-dovey (lol) to them in a swimsuit? And... I'll take my earnest revenge!

She's just Kama getting more active on her attempts to seduce her Master because that's how things go on summer.\n\n\nIf anything, forcing herself too much on the offensive made her defensively weak. In other words, she's doesn't think things through. She offers a drink for them to share on a couple's straw, but when it's time to actually drink it, she gets all red and palpitating.

The incarnated compilation of the animals who have been oppressed by humanity.\n\nShe chose to model her Spirit Origin on Tamamo no Mae for the vessel of her incarnation, as they share the same attributes (Both are beasts who should exist to exact revenge on humanity).\n\n\nAs for Tamamo no Mae, she says;\n\n“I don’t know if that’s one of my Tails… I don’t quite remember… but it looks like me, right? Hey, could it be Tamamo Alter?”\n\n\nHer sense of identity could be vexing.\n\nImmediately after starting her company for the sake of exterminating humanity, she was contacted by the “Alien God”, and they came to an agreement of mutual non-hostility, and after that, she ostensibly acted in collaboration with the “Alien God’s” plan.\n\nAs a matter of fact, although her manifestation appears to have been in order to fill the vacant seat of the Fourth Beast, it seems Koyanskaya swapped jobs in order to enjoy watching “the mutual destruction of Chaldea and the Alien God”, rather than compete as a rival.\n\nBy the way, they are rabbit ears, not fox ears. She exists for the good of the rabbits, whose spirit is “their fate is to be hunted by predators”, so she is a bitter foe to all predators, whether friend or foe, but is conversely kind to the living creatures who are preyed upon."],

In order to honour the request of her friend, Muryan, who she met in the Sixth Lostbelt, which was “Please, protect Britain”, she successfully protected “the only ones who could possibly save Britain, Chaldea (the Storm Border)” from the Hands of the Festival God Cernunnos, and immediately after that, Oberon’s plan to inject the amassed “Stagnation” of Cernunnos caused her Spirit Origin to enlarge. Unable to control her own power anymore, she retreated from the Sixth Lostbelt.\n\nAfter that, in a rampaging state, Koyanskaya retreated to the “Non-Primate Biosphere” that had been developing and hiding on the Blank Slate Earth, and unwillingly began her eclosion (it was too early, but she had no choice).\n\n\n◆\n\n\nAlthough she materialized as an Evil of Humanity, from the beginning to the end, she remained immature, and never became a calamity against humanity (As the Beast of Treasuring, she chose not to attack humanity directly out of pride), thus, she bears no inscription as a Beast.\n\n\nWith that as her conclusion, she was denied the Class.\n\nThe name of the country-ruining lady was a lie.\n\nShe was a biosphere that could not discard humanity, and now continues to move with Human History.\n\nHer name is Beast IV: Lost.\n\n\nWhile trying to become one of the Seven Evils of Humanity, she was a Beast who carried the principle of “Treasuring”."]

Sancho saw the fear in her lord and decided to use her Noble Phantasm. They succeeded in escaping Atlantis but stumbled into the Traum Singularity.\n\nFaced with the armies of Servants plotting rebellion against Human Order, Sancho crafted a makeshift plan to survive: establishing the Via Regia Realm under the guise of Karl der Große. There, they would secretly gather Pan-Human Servants and fight any safe fights, but they weren't in the best circumstances to gather Servants, which put them in a clearly disadvantageous situation.\n\n\nThat's when Chaldea rayshifted and joined forces with them, leading the Via Regia Realm to challenge the Revenge and Restoration Realms into war...\n\nAlso, Don Quixote always wanted to apologize to Chaldea's Master. Sancho believes that he didn't need to because he gave his best and it was just that his best wasn't enough, and she's right about that, but for Don Quixote, what he did was an unacceptable betrayal of his chivalric code.\n\n\nIn Traum, he once again preserved his virtue to the very end, fighting alongside Sancho until his last breath."]

I am invincible!\"\n\nIgnore the obvious argument that being a Servant, she's also a departed soul. She used her Imperial Priledge to devise her Imperial Tao Arts (Zetian-original Tao Arts fine-tuned to steamroll the dead. She took most tips from jiangshi movies.). And so she started treating her familiar-like enforcers as jiangshi.\n\n\nShe is in the best of moods for having conquered one of her weaknesses. With techniques to counter departed souls, Wu Zetian started spending her days with the ghosts under her whip, as if in retaliation for all she had been through before...\n\n\nIs she really over her fear...?

Cats still glared at her with spiteful eyes. She couldn't use spells that she knew didn't work. To stabilize her Swimsuit Saint Graph, her Class needed to be converted to Caster, but due to that past, this was difficult. As such, Skadi used her runes to seal the memory of how the Tao Arts she learned were useless.\n\n\nBy believing in her own Tao magecraft, Wu Zetian could transform into her Swimsuit Saint Graph and seemingly forget her fear of ghosts. She is simply in the mindset of \"they're not scary because I can beat them\". Her summertime dream will end either when the end of summer makes her remember how her magecraft was useless, or when she meets a ghost with valid reasons to haunt her, which her Saint Graph can't exorcise because she'll get thinking that her Tao Art might fail (since the ghost is the one in the right).\n\n\nYes... After everything she tried, at her core, she still believes even now that all the political enemies she assassinated to take over the country have all the right to direct their grudges and resentments at her, and that spirits will inevitably curse her. But this sensation comes from her pride telling her that she's not too weak to handle it and that she doesn't regret usurping the throne. Naturally, being the hard worker that she is, she continued looking for a way to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) after the summer was over."]
