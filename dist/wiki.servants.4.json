How am I supposed to pester her if she won't seriously fear and be wary of me...?\"\n\n\nTherefore, she made her decision. This is where she'll aim for the home run. Change her name tag from the god of love to the Demon King of corruption and display her presence for everyone to see.\n\nAnd then came the summer, her perfect chance.\n\n\n\"I'll take this nice opportunity and do my best to corrupt Master. I mean, just look at me. Who wouldn't be corrupted if I acted all lovey-dovey (lol) to them in a swimsuit? And... I'll take my earnest revenge!

She's just Kama getting more active on her attempts to seduce her Master because that's how things go on summer.\n\n\nIf anything, forcing herself too much on the offensive made her defensively weak. In other words, she's doesn't think things through. She offers a drink for them to share on a couple's straw, but when it's time to actually drink it, she gets all red and palpitating.

I am invincible!\"\n\nIgnore the obvious argument that being a Servant, she's also a departed soul. She used her Imperial Priledge to devise her Imperial Tao Arts (Zetian-original Tao Arts fine-tuned to steamroll the dead. She took most tips from jiangshi movies.). And so she started treating her familiar-like enforcers as jiangshi.\n\n\nShe is in the best of moods for having conquered one of her weaknesses. With techniques to counter departed souls, Wu Zetian started spending her days with the ghosts under her whip, as if in retaliation for all she had been through before...\n\n\nIs she really over her fear...?

Cats still glared at her with spiteful eyes. She couldn't use spells that she knew didn't work. To stabilize her Swimsuit Saint Graph, her Class needed to be converted to Caster, but due to that past, this was difficult. As such, Skadi used her runes to seal the memory of how the Tao Arts she learned were useless.\n\n\nBy believing in her own Tao magecraft, Wu Zetian could transform into her Swimsuit Saint Graph and seemingly forget her fear of ghosts. She is simply in the mindset of \"they're not scary because I can beat them\". Her summertime dream will end either when the end of summer makes her remember how her magecraft was useless, or when she meets a ghost with valid reasons to haunt her, which her Saint Graph can't exorcise because she'll get thinking that her Tao Art might fail (since the ghost is the one in the right).\n\n\nYes... After everything she tried, at her core, she still believes even now that all the political enemies she assassinated to take over the country have all the right to direct their grudges and resentments at her, and that spirits will inevitably curse her. But this sensation comes from her pride telling her that she's not too weak to handle it and that she doesn't regret usurping the throne. Naturally, being the hard worker that she is, she continued looking for a way to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) after the summer was over."]
