Don Quixote's name became known around the world as a form of criticism for dreamers.\n\n\nIn his story, Don Quixote is a poor hidalgo of 50 years old that got so immersed in knightly romances that he sold his fields. His madness gradually convinced him he was a knight-errant, throwing him on an adventure accompanied by his skinny and aged horse Rocinante and his squire Sancho.\n\n\nHe dared charge against windmills he assumed to be giants. He was banned from farms for treating the farmhands' daughters like princesses. He defeated Sanson Carrasco when the bachiller disguised himself as a knight in an attempt to bring Quixote back to reality.\n\n\nAnd then, when Sanson Carrasco recovered from his wounds, he disguised himself as a different knight and defeated Don Quixote in another duel, making the old man promise to live a quiet year in his home village.\n\nAs Carrasco predicted, Don Quixote tottered back to the village, but what actually healed his madness was a nearly fatal fever.\n\n\nAfter 6 days of suffering, Don Quixote was once again Alonso Quijano. Despite lamenting the silliness of his knightly tales, he preserved his human virtue until the day he died. And that was the most precious thing Don Quixote had hoped for since the day he became a knight. That's exactly what makes the story of the old knight so beloved all over the world to this day."],

Sancho saw the fear in her lord and decided to use her Noble Phantasm. They succeeded in escaping Atlantis but stumbled into the Traum Singularity.\n\nFaced with the armies of Servants plotting rebellion against Human Order, Sancho crafted a makeshift plan to survive: establishing the Via Regia Realm under the guise of Karl der Große. There, they would secretly gather Pan-Human Servants and fight any safe fights, but they weren't in the best circumstances to gather Servants, which put them in a clearly disadvantageous situation.\n\n\nThat's when Chaldea rayshifted and joined forces with them, leading the Via Regia Realm to challenge the Revenge and Restoration Realms into war...\n\nAlso, Don Quixote always wanted to apologize to Chaldea's Master. Sancho believes that he didn't need to because he gave his best and it was just that his best wasn't enough, and she's right about that, but for Don Quixote, what he did was an unacceptable betrayal of his chivalric code.\n\n\nIn Traum, he once again preserved his virtue to the very end, fighting alongside Sancho until his last breath."]

She used her Imperial Priledge to devise her Imperial Tao Arts (Zetian-original Tao Arts fine-tuned to steamroll the dead. She took most tips from jiangshi movies.). And so she started treating her familiar-like enforcers as jiangshi.\n\n\nShe is in the best of moods for having conquered one of her weaknesses. With techniques to counter departed souls, Wu Zetian started spending her days with the ghosts under her whip, as if in retaliation for all she had been through before...\n\n\nIs she really over her fear...?

However, they're also able of walking like normal.\n\n\nAlso, by attaching the talisman to the forehead and using the spell, she can control people other than her officers as jiangshi to some extent, meaning she's always open to hiring new recruits.\n\nGather, motivated and competent jiangshi applicants! You too can have a gorgeous boss, a job that contributes to society, and torture so fantastic it will change you forever when you make any mistakes!"],
    "6": ["If Wu Zetian was always able of using Tao Arts, something doesn't make sense. Why was she afraid of spirits up until this point? The answer is: because her Tao Arts had no effect in the past. They didn't work. No matter how many times she repeated her incantations, the spirits of the ones she poisoned kept showing up. Cats still glared at her with spiteful eyes. She couldn't use spells that she knew didn't work. To stabilize her Swimsuit Saint Graph, her Class needed to be converted to Caster, but due to that past, this was difficult. As such, Skadi used her runes to seal the memory of how the Tao Arts she learned were useless.\n\n\nBy believing in her own Tao magecraft, Wu Zetian could transform into her Swimsuit Saint Graph and seemingly forget her fear of ghosts. She is simply in the mindset of \"they're not scary because I can beat them\". Her summertime dream will end either when the end of summer makes her remember how her magecraft was useless, or when she meets a ghost with valid reasons to haunt her, which her Saint Graph can't exorcise because she'll get thinking that her Tao Art might fail (since the ghost is the one in the right).\n\n\nYes... After everything she tried, at her core, she still believes even now that all the political enemies she assassinated to take over the country have all the right to direct their grudges and resentments at her, and that spirits will inevitably curse her. But this sensation comes from her pride telling her that she's not too weak to handle it and that she doesn't regret usurping the throne. Naturally, being the hard worker that she is, she continued looking for a way to overcome her fear of spirits (and cats) after the summer was over."]

The nameless monk of peasant upbringing preached theology to the people, gathered followers, and eventually gained the Tsar's trust, making him a major figure in the state's dissolution. He was the subject of much gossip, plausible or otherwise, and later generations came to know him as the Mad Monk due to the mysterious miracles he performed.\n\nHe deepened his amity with the Russian imperial family when he saved Tsar Nikolai II's son and heir Tsarevich Alexei from illness, earning him great political influence, which caused him to be shunned by the nobility. His upbringing and uninhibited companionship with his female followers caused the orthodox clergy to disregard him as heretic and immoral, and popular rumors told that he was using the Tsar as a puppet for his interests. Rasputin lived with many enemies but never ever changed his beliefs and behaviors.\n\n\nRasputin was even considered one of the causes of Imperial Russia's collapse, but in reality, he strongly advocated for a pacific resolution to the battle against Germany shortly before World War I. He remained a pacifist afterward, making him an obstacle to the people wishing for war in both countries. Also, Rasputin was a lecher, but rather than living in luxury, he made a point to always live a frugal life.\n\nOn December 17th, 1916, he was assassinated by the military and nobility lamenting the future of Imperial Russia. During the assassination, he wouldn't die from eating a meal laced with potassium cyanide, forcing the killer to change the cause of death to a revolver shot. He still wouldn't die from 2 bullets, one to the heart and one to the lung, so after more fire, they finally confirmed his death. Afterward, they threw his body off the Petrovsky Bridge.

As a survivor of the Fourth Holy Grail War, he inherited the role of overseer. He was a qualified Executor and skilled in mediunic cure. It's easy to see him as someone who prefers destroying, but Kirei is a mage who \"creates\", exactly like Emiya Shirou. His ability to heal mental and spiritual wounds is at a Presbyter's level.
