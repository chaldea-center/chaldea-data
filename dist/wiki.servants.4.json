However, the Emperor of the Later Han sent Ma Yuan (an ancestor of Ma Chao of \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\") to suppress the rebellion. Though Hai Bà Trưng fought valiantly, they were ultimately defeated after the feudal lords abandoned them after beginning to see them as the losing side.\n\n\nIn the final moments of their lives, some say the sisters were beheaded.

Unsurprisingly, the only person who really understands Nhị, and can tell how she truly feels, is Trắc. Incidentally, while her sister will always come first, she's secretly very fond of anything she thinks is cute.\n\n\n\"Just tell me what you need, Big Si[line 2]uh, Trắc, and I'll make sure it happens.\"\n\n\"I'll destroy anything that threatens your happiness.\"\n\n(Oh man Big Sis is so cute when she's tired and rolling around like that...

Even amongst unworldly True Ancestors, her abilities are top class. A mediocre vampire has no chance of defeating her.\n\n\nHowever, being a True Ancestor is synonymous with being unable to restrain their craving for blood.

In both her 1st and 3rd Ascensions, she views battle as a 'competition to create, combine and control different elements'.\n\n\nIn the world of Tsukihime, the strongest existence of a celestial body is known as the Ultimate One (Original One), a position that the awakened Arcueid is applicable for.

In doing so, he learned that King Zhòu killed his mother and aunt and became furious. Father and son faced Chen Tong together. Tianhua absorbed Tong's Fire Dragon's Dart into a mysterious flower basket, then cut his head with the weapon his mentor gave him: the Sword of Mo Ye.\n\n\nThe Sword of Mo Ye is the treasure of Daode Zhenjun's mountain. A paope that lops people's heads off with the light it emits.\n\nServant Huang Feihu can borrow Huang Tianhua's Noble Phantasm as his own, including the power from stories associated with Tianhua.\n\nIt's association with other swords engraved with the name 'Moye' is unknown."]

Rasputin was a hard worker who devoted himself to the Lord's teachings and learned God's secrets despite his peasant birth providing him with no incentive to learn to read at the time. His vessel is a priest who studied proper theology at the Church, but his mindset shows some similarities to Rasputin's.\n\nSince he's a mix of Russian orthodoxy, Zoroastrianism, and aboriginal folklore, his Blessings of Faith possess an effect different from the regular version of the Skill.

    "3": ["• Historical figure and character\n\nGregori Rasputin was a monk active in the last years of Imperial Russia. The Precant. The nameless monk of peasant upbringing preached theology to the people, gathered followers, and eventually gained the Tsar's trust, making him a major figure in the state's dissolution. He was the subject of much gossip, plausible or otherwise, and later generations came to know him as the Mad Monk due to the mysterious miracles he performed.\n\nHe deepened his amity with the Russian imperial family when he saved Tsar Nikolai II's son and heir Tsarevich Alexei from illness, earning him great political influence, which caused him to be shunned by the nobility. His upbringing and uninhibited companionship with his female followers caused the orthodox clergy to disregard him as heretic and immoral, and popular rumors told that he was using the Tsar as a puppet for his interests. Rasputin lived with many enemies but never ever changed his beliefs and behaviors.\n\n\nRasputin was even considered one of the causes of Imperial Russia's collapse, but in reality, he strongly advocated for a pacific resolution to the battle against Germany shortly before World War I. He remained a pacifist afterward, making him an obstacle to the people wishing for war in both countries. Also, Rasputin was a lecher, but rather than living in luxury, he made a point to always live a frugal life.\n\nOn December 17th, 1916, he was assassinated by the military and nobility lamenting the future of Imperial Russia. During the assassination, he wouldn't die from eating a meal laced with potassium cyanide, forcing the killer to change the cause of death to a revolver shot. He still wouldn't die from 2 bullets, one to the heart and one to the lung, so after more fire, they finally confirmed his death. Afterward, they threw his body off the Petrovsky Bridge. There are no records explaining why the assassin did such a thing to the body."],
    "4": ["Pseudo-Servants take either the host or the Heroic Spirit as the main component, and in Rasputin's case, the main component is Father Kotomine. This is presumably a result of Rasputin voluntarily refraining from exposing the wills and opinions that come from being reincarnated as present-day Servant, either due to him being a man of similar character to Father Kotomine or due to their mutual respect for each other's way of life.\n\n\nRasputin was concerned about Anastasia's future in the Russian Lostbelt, so after watching her conclusion, Heroic Spirit Rasputin's will receded, leaving only Father Kotomine entrusted with Rasputin's powers to serve as an apostle of the Alien God.\n\nThe apostles of the Alien God are special Servants made from multiple Heroic Spirits mixed into a single vessel. Aside from Rasputin, Father Kotomine was also imbued with the essences of\n\n\n- The three-headed wicked dragon Azi Dahaka, a confidant of one of the two pillars of Zoroastrian dualism: the evil god Angra Mainyu.\n\n\n- Bahloo from Australian folklore, the immortal moon sprite who commands three dogs (snakes) and always comes back from the dead.\n\n\n• In another timeline\n\nAn overseer selected by the two major organizations: the Holy Church and the Mage's Association. In his 20s, he participated in a Fuyuki Holy Grail War where his father was the overseer. After this event, he switched sides to the Mage's Association at the Church's orders. As a survivor of the Fourth Holy Grail War, he inherited the role of overseer. He was a qualified Executor and skilled in mediunic cure. It's easy to see him as someone who prefers destroying, but Kirei is a mage who \"creates\", exactly like Emiya Shirō. His ability to heal mental and spiritual wounds is at a Presbyter's level.

Its effect deals increased damage to those of the Evil alignment and produces a (minor) insta-kill effect on the Good alignment.

The world is stable because of the sacrifice of important things) and even Quetzalcoatl (who tried to break the existing rule that living sacrifice is important) threatened the world."]

    "2": ["He was born into the Takasugi clan, a prestigious family that had served the Mōri clan for generations since the Sengoku era.\n\n\nAt first he attended Meirinkan, a feudal domain school, but he found their practices of allowing only samurai to attend, stiff formal lessons, among many others, so utterly archaic that he enrolled into Shōka Sonjuku, an academy taken over by Yoshida Shōin, a previous top student at Meirinkan.\n\n\nUnlike Meirinkan, he found Shōka Sonjuku, or rather Shōin's classes, stupidly interesting, and he quickly rose to prominence as Shōin's disciple. He also went to Edo to study abroad, but his teacher, Yoshida Shōin, was captured and executed due to the Ansei Purge. This is when he began to openly speak of overthrowing the shogunate.\n\n\nFollowing these events, Takasugi joined a delegation under the shogunate and studied in Shanghai. Witnessing the threat posed by the Western powers, he grew even more concerned about the future of Japan and the overthrowing of the shogunate.\n\n\nAfter returning to Japan, he joined the Sonnō Jōi movement and mingled with samurai from various clans in Edo and Kyoto. But even amongst these samurai, Takasugi was an exceptionally unconventional man with numerous radical acts such as setting the British legation on fire.\n\n\nThe Chōshū domain tried to keep Takasugi obedient by assigning him to a position, but he immediately turned it down. He continued to be nonsensical, saying that he would fool around for a decade and shave his head. He also stated he would go somewhere far away, but he ended up playing his shamisen and composing songs in his hometown.\n\n\nChōshū bombarded the Americans, French and Dutch in Shimonoseki, and promptly got pummeled by them. Frightened by this outcome, Chōshū entrusted Takasugi with defending Shimonoseki. As a result, Takasugi established the \"Kiheitai\", a modernized militia not bound by social status. However, following some disputes, he was soon dismissed as the leader of the Kiheitai. \"Damn clansmen, complaining over the littlest things.\"\n\n\nAnyhow, after this and that, Chōshū became the enemy of the imperial government after the Hamaguri Rebellion, and they continued to be bombarded by the combined naval forces of four nations in Shimonoseki. \"It's over now!\" they thought, but for some reason the Chōshū clan once again asked Takasugi, who was imprisoned at the time, to negotiate a peace agreement. However, Takasugi was only too eager to sabotage this peace conference, and he developed an Ultra C plan to force the shogunate to pay reparations instead. At the meeting, Takasugi put up a show by suddenly reciting the Kojiki and even pretending not to hear about the concession of Hikoshima.\n\n\nWhile all of this was going on, the First Chōshū expedition was approaching, and a faction of the Chōshū clan loyal to the shogunate emerged to try to accept the shogunate's demands. Takasugi was so enraged by this that he commanded a troop with a miniscule number of men at Kōzanji. As reckless as his decision was to command a troop, Takasugi and his men in a state of maximum tension, marched into Hagi and wiped out the faction loyal to the shogunate. As a result, the Chōshū were now unified in its policy to overthrow the shogunate. The Second Chōshū expedition by the Shogunate was commenced in response to this act. Everyone believed that Chōshū was now done for, but Chōshū, perhaps having had a taste of success, decided to appoint Takasugi as their naval commander. Takasugi then took command of the navy and won a great victory against the shogunate fleet. This battle's victory undermined the authority of the shogunate, which in turn contributed to the Meiji Restoration.\n\n\nHowever, Takasugi, who had been afflicted by illness, died of pulmonary tuberculosis without seeing imperial rule fully restored.\n\"Ah, I was just getting to the best part, too.\""],

It's fun to swing around.\n\n\nDuring normal combat, he wields his homemade Molotov cocktails and shamisen blades, and on top of that he even summons and manipulates a miniature prototype model called Prototype Arahabaki, demonstrating his reckless fighting style. If anything, my style looks more like a Rider than an Archer, but I'm not the kind of guy to fit the mold, so you should appreciate that about me.\n\n\nThis combat style was derived from events in the Meiji Restoration City Saitama singularity, but due to the nature of his peculiar Noble Phantasm and dramatic fate, it became engraved into Takasugi's Spirit Origin."],

It is a difficult Noble Phantasm to use, as it requires managing the finer details such as determining the enemy's weaknesses, selecting the necessary equipment, and adjusting one's skills. Essentially, it is a supporting Noble Phantasm that enhances its allies.\n\n\nIn its fully unleashed version, in other words the ace up his sleeve, it is possible for Takasugi to summon the strongest army he can imagine and utilize it temporarily.\n\n\nDue to the effects of the Noble Phantasm described above, it is possible to summon or select a large number of soldiers with Servant-class combat power with the best equipment, skills and abilities needed to suit the battlefield, as well as operate and strengthen said soldiers as a unit. However, once unleashed, it is a self-destructive Noble Phantasm that rapidly wears down Takasugi's Spirit Origin and places a tremendous burden on him, so its operational time is short and it becomes difficult to activate again.\n\n\nIncidentally, the equipment and weapons to be enhanced will become the latest armaments available in that era, so its effects may vary. For example, the Stone Age will summon stone axes, and the early modern era will summon bombers, thus making this a romantic Noble Phantasm that you never know will be strong or weak."],
