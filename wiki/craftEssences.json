    "NA": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh... \n\n...The excerpt ends there."

He went so far as to dismiss his creations before the \"Thirty-Six Views\" as worthless doodles. It is said he started to grasp the essence of all animal's skeletal structures and the secret of life for all plants at the age of 73. By eighty, he had furthered his understanding of all things in nature. By ninety, he had reached enlightenment. Had he lived to one hundred years old, his skill might have reached the realm of the divine. By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\n\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting. Even as he sensed his own end, he did not give in to despair and continued his endless pursuit of artistic heights none before him had ever attained."

Auntie and Medea Lily!\n\n\nThey said they were going to convert it into a kitchen so they could make confections!\n\nAnd they were going to call it the Witches’ Kitchen, and it will only be open on Valentine’s Day!\n\nWhat a nuisance. Besides, calling it the Witches’ Kitchen is a bad idea. It’s like blatantly admitting that the food has special properties and ingredients!\n\nBut then Auntie said...\n\n“We, as highly celebrated witches of myth, must create and use only objects of the highest quality...from confectionary-making tools to aprons! It’s like just like how one must have the proper feathers if one wishes to fly!”\n\n...She was quite enthusiastic about it.\n\nJust the fact that she’s spending time making sweets is taking away from her being a witch...

Do you think they like it really sweet? Or would bitter be better?”\n\n“Are there any seasonings Master doesn’t like? You know, so I can balance things properly in the future..”\n\n“Now that I think about it, handmade confections are so lame. What do you think, Medea?”\n\n“If Master was a pig in their past life, what breed do you think they’d have been? I hear there’s a hybrid brand of pigs called Tokyo ● from Japan. Sounds romantic, huh? It has ● in its name!”\n\nWho cares about breeds...\n\n“Hey Medea...I hear that Master is really traumatized by Valentine’s Day. Even if they eat our chocolates with a smile while we watch, I hear there’s vomiting back in Master’s room... Sounds like a joke, doesn’t it? Huh?”\n\n\n...So, there you have it. Phew.\n\nAnyway, it looks like Auntie’s a bit occupied right now and she can’t come over, so she sent me here on her behalf. Really, Lily should be doing this, not me.\n\nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don’t you agree, Master?\n\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she’s doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked? \n\nOh, it’s fine. You don’t need to be so formal and thank me...eh?\n\nI-I keep telling you! \n\nI-I-I’m Medea!!! Really! Honest!\n\nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I’m not lying!!!\n\nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!"

It is said that his experience during this crash was what inspired him to write the novella \"The Little Prince\". Saint-Exupéry was a plane enthusiast, so much so he purchased yet another airplane even after his crash, going so as far as to incur considerable debt. Throughout his life, he had many crashes and accidents. One such accident at the age of twenty-three caused him to break off an engagement. At the age of thirty-five, when he crash landed in a desert, he managed to survive for four days on only one day's worth of water until he was rescued by a nomadic tribe called the Bedouin. Finally at the age of forty-four, he was assigned to a military scouting mission using an unarmed aircraft. He was shot down and finally met his demise.\n\n\nWhile he was a well-known author, he was an aviator at heart, a man who continued to look up to the sky.\n\n\n\"...Well, at least that's how the legend goes. A model of a crashed airplane might be lame, but I'm actually attached to it.\""

It's probably close in style of that sunflower painting that sold for a few million. But this painting for you should go perfectly well on the right side of the wall in your drab room. And if for some unfortunate reason you find yourself struggling, you can go ahead and sell it. But when you do, I look forward to you buying me a cup of coffee and telling me the story of how much that \"painting of an unknown monster girl with an authentic Van Gogh autograph\" sold for.\n\nIt looks like I'm reaching my limit with my advanced Van Gogh joke of borrowing Vincent's artistic talent and writing style. The haughtiness is crushing me, and I still need to explain myself to Gioconda Da Vinci who keeps banging on my door on why I used so much painting materials during my many trial and errors for this painting. (Though her existence as an artist still puzzles me no matter how many times I hear the story). Luckily Hokusai's with me so she can probably side with me. Oh...as I was writing this sentence, she took off leaving the little black Hokusai behind, so now I don't have anyone else to sweet talk my way out!\nI'm going to entrust this letter and painting to the little black Hokusai. If you see me in the halls nursing a bump on my head, some treatment and consolation would be appreciated.\n\n\nWith my unwavering loyalty and friendship, a handshake to you."

But that’s it.\n\nI can’t feel the so-called ‘love’ that society speaks of.”\n\n\nBeauty is the reciprocity of giving and receiving love.\n\nApparently, this man can’t experience such joy and satisfaction.\n\n\n“Beauty should be in the past tense.\n\nOnly when you lose or damage something do you realize how irreplaceable it was to you.\n\nThat’s lamentation, not appreciation. What makes it more beautiful than anything else is the fact that you will never get it back.”\n\n\nI couldn’t agree with him.\n\nBecause that’s—\n\n\n“Yep, I get what you’re trying to say. And you’re right, my friend.\n\nAny proof of my love is lost the moment I harm to feel love.\n\nCompletely meaningless, I tell you. No salvation, no recompense to be found.\n\nSo it’s actually pretty simple then: Just don’t love in the first place.”\n\n\nThe man replied as if he’s telling an amusing story, then he left his seat.\n\n―In the distance, an ambulance’s siren was blaring, evoking the image of death."
