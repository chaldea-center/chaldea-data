When she shouts \"Tíng (stay)!\" they stop in mid-air, and they return to her hand when she shouts \"Lái (come)!\"\n\n\nBut there was a time when Nezha didn't carry the Universe Rings.\n\nThey were taken from her in the battle against Lady Rock, and later retrieved by Taiyi Zhenren, who kept them temporarily.\n\nFrom the time of Nezha's suicide to save her human parents and atone for her sins until her rebirth, they were out of her possession.\n\nTo Nezha, this Baobei is closely associated with humiliating and regrettable memories. Therefore, she would never entrust the Universe Rings to another unless she trusted them absolutely.\n\n\nIf there was someone whom Nezha trusted enough to give one of the Rings, it would mean that she considered that person so close as to be a part of herself. And it would also represent a vow that she will always resurrect and come back to the holder, no matter what."

    "NA": "This \"key\" supposedly existed in Salem, Massachusetts for a time. It was there for a few decades, but considering the key's existence is measured in centuries, that time span is just a blink of an eye. The key was methodically preserved by a thaumaturgist, who came from England. It was wrapped in parchment and then placed inside a box made out of fragrant wood that emitted a sweet-smelling aroma. The key granted special powers to the possessor. But it couldn't be in the hands of just anybody. There were specific conditions that had to be met. The conditions were that the individual had to be innocent, possess the heart of a child, and have knowledge of magecraft. This was because the key was connected to the dream world. This was due to the fact that, according to the \"Book of Eibon,\" \"Necronomicon,\" and other grimoires, the key was created by a thaumaturgist who came from the northern continent that had sunk during the Glacial Period. While it is indeed called a key since it closely resembled the excavated artifacts from the ruins of Rome, there was no lock that was paired with it. It was essentially a key based off of a concept, and it should have actually been called something similar to a staff that thaumaturgists wield. When the catastrophe that was the Witch Trials of Salem occurred, the key should have been lost and hidden away as just another myth or superstition. However, it found an individual who met the conditions to inherit it. The girl's name was Abigail Williams. The girl rightfully and correctly used the key, handed to her by the Demon God Pillar, during sunset, when the hills of the execution site turned crimson the moment the celestial bodies aligned. Iä! Iä! The red seal on the devil's tome inscribed by the women suspected to be witches... The same knots of the same number of nine seals were handled with the same motion fit for each seal...and the girl opened up the door that led to the \"Boundary.\" Iä! Iä! Y-grah'n li'gai gai! Those who gaze back on us from within the abyss of falsity. O lord of the ultimate gate who reigns beyond the corridors of dreams. O, All-in-One and One-in-All being. We must caution those who come in contact with the young girl. The girl's existence shall put the world into uncertainty. But... Oh... Ohhh...\n\n\n...The excerpt ends there."

By one hundred and ten, he could have made his paintings come alive.\n\nArtists of his time understood the rising dragon over Mt. Fuji to be an auspicious sign, one that signifies a person's rise to success. However, one can also see Hokusai's endless conviction in this painting.

Really, Lily should be doing this, not me.\n\nHonestly, Auntie is so fickle she gives me a headache. Teehee. Don't you agree, Master?\n\nBut it does look like, in spite of herself, she's doing her best, so would you be so kind as to answer the questions I asked?\n\nOh, it's fine. You don't need to be so formal and thank me...eh?\n\nI-I keep telling you!\n\nI-I-I'm Medea!!! Really! Honest!\n\nI-I-I-I told you when I got here! I'm not lying!!!\n\nHonestly, you are SO rude!!!"

Crap.\n\n\n\"At the edge of distant time,\n\nthe gods, demons, and human prayers all intertwined to create this fragment of light.\n\nIt stands here, in the land of eternity.\""

Those girls then become aware of the wishes of people around them, granting those wishes at random...and so are called a God Child.\n\n\nThe first child saved Fuyuki from famine, and died at the age of two. The second child's psyche was exhausted before their life ended. From the third child and beyond, their births were concealed.\n\n\nThe girls of the Sakatsuki household were then raised only by their mothers, secreted away within a boundary that shielded them from human thought. The ritual was meant to enable god to enter into a human body. It is done in quiet stillness, without thought or hesitation. This method of raising the Sakatsuki girls is cold and empty, the opposite of how a child is typically brought up.\n\n\nThen what, exactly, are these toy balls doing here?\n\n\nThe faint memories of time spent with Mother. Mother and child spent their hollow, monotonous days together in an almost mechanical indifference to each other. But as the God Child gained more human awareness, she finally realizes something: her mother did love her."

I didn't mean to make you jealous.\n\nDon't worry. There may be an opportunity for me to change the car's name to your own... That is, if you can entertain me more than her...or rather, if you become one of my favorites...\n\n\nAnd that's why you'll be showing me how cute you are tonight.\n\nEven if you're scared, I won't let you close your eyes. Open your eyes properly and indulge yourself in my illusion and speed.\n\nAre you ready? I'm going to floor it!\""

It is said that his experience during this crash was what inspired him to write the novella \"The Little Prince\". Saint-Exupéry was a plane enthusiast, so much so he purchased yet another airplane even after his crash, going so as far as to incur considerable debt. Throughout his life, he had many crashes and accidents. One such accident at the age of twenty-three caused him to break off an engagement. At the age of thirty-five, when he crash landed in a desert, he managed to survive for four days on only one day's worth of water until he was rescued by a nomadic tribe called the Bedouin. Finally at the age of forty-four, he was assigned to a military scouting mission using an unarmed aircraft. He was shot down and finally met his demise.\n\n\nWhile he was a well-known author, he was an aviator at heart, a man who continued to look up to the sky.\n\n\n\"...Well, at least that's how the legend goes. A model of a crashed airplane might be lame, but I'm actually attached to it.\""

Everything was executed masterfully, and the weight of her bulging bag full of presents was just as much of a threat as a swing of her black sacred sword. I only won because the ring was too small for her sled.\n\n\nThe second Santa was just in a different division, so it ended with no contest. I didn't even fight her. She just gave up the belt. But at the same time, we were able to talk about what a Santa should be. This belt without a doubt carries her feelings as well.\n\n\nThe third Santa was a formidable opponent. Had she been in a better condition, I might have been in trouble. Did you know that sheep's wool absorbs impact from punches? That was truly a great learning experience for me.\n\n\nOh right. I do have to say that the fourth Santa was my strongest opponent yet. She came straight at me in close quarters. She used very strange steps that prevented my punches from hitting, and her numerous killer Christmas techniques... Honestly, I don't know that I would fare better if I went up against her in the future. I would very much like a rematch, and I'm sure the feeling is mutual. Perhaps I should also incorporate that rhythm into my footwork. Samba...she called it?\n\n\nThe fifth Santa was a terrifying opponent...in a different way. I can't believe she tried attacking a boxer with a syringe... Even if she did that out of kindness, there was no way I was going to allow myself to take such a hit. I'd immediately be disqualified the moment I was suspected of doping. So in a sense, this match kept me on my toes the most.\n\n\nSo I managed to obtain this through those battles...but to be honest, I shouldn't be the one wearing this belt.\n\n\nI think it should be given to Master, who handled me as Santa Claus so well. But I can't seem to convince them to accept it. That why...at best, I should probably be considered the provisional champion. It's likely there will be another Santa next year. I guess I'll just have to keep on training until a title match with them gets arranged..."

You could say he succeeded in all sectors of entertainment, but the one feat he failed to achieve...was building a casino resort. I established NFF Services because I thought it a shame he left that unfinished.\"\n\n\nThe bewitching beauty, clad in a dealer's uniform, continues. She explains how simple it would be to conjure a city using her Authority. But that would be pointless. A city made for entertaining humans must be built by human systems. Success and bankruptcy are two sides of the same coin. She set out to construct the planet's largest casino resort to experience that successive tragedy and joy. The giant building, which can only resemble a ribbon, symbolizes the soul which inhabits that place.\n\n\n\"Anyway, before you get the wrong idea... The greed of all mankind is no more valuable than one of my hairpins. Once I tire of it, I can just toss it into the sea. Don't go making the mistake of thinking I actually love you people, dear.\""

Yet even after being run through with their blades, the god spoke not a word of anger or resentment towards his killers.

That's how he became the Zanzaburo he is today.\n\n\nAfterwards, we began traveling together, dancing together, and vanquishing evil together.\n\n\nI may not know who my parents were, or where I was born, or really anything about myself, so in one sense, Zanzaburo is really the only family I have...\n\n\nOh, but that's enough for the sappiness.

    "NA": "Nock the arrow on the bow, then shoot it.\n\nAn iron arrowhead can easily pierce through a human's body.\n\nSince the human's body is basically like a bag stuffed full of meat and water put inside a layer of skin, if a sharp object was to pierce it, death would be the most likely outcome.\n\n\nThen, if a monster like me, if someone like me was to shoot humans, what would happen?\n\nFive, even ten bodies would be hollowed out, and even the castle gates would be simply destroyed.\n\n\nIn that case, what about a ship?\n\nThe result is as you can see.\n\nMy arrow has ripped the ship to pieces and left its people drowning.\n\n\nThat single blow should have raised my spirits also pained me a little.\n\nIf death by arrow is called a glorious death, then death by the destruction of the ship probably would be considered a cruel death.\n\nYou remain within the midst of battle, yet not fighting, just struggling in the water.\n\n\nMy arrow was never an arrow of mercy.\n\nI want you to remember this, Master.\n\nWe consider battles and death an honour, and we fight against it without fear.\n\nEven so, behind it all....There are countless cruel death as such.\n\n\nFighting is not good at all.\n\nA combat machine like me, saying such a thing―――I must have sounded like quite the laughing stock."
